This document is intended to cover Docker Engine installation issue. 


Scenario 1: Installing Docker CE on CentOS 8.4 Server GUI
Installing Docker CE on Centos 8.4 should be pretty simple using the script https://get.docker.com/
However you should consider some pre-requisites to perform a smooth installation of Docker CE 

Version Involved:
Linux : CentOS Linux release 8.4.2105
Docker : Docker version 20.10.7, build f0df350

CentOS 8.4 Server GUI version is found to have default containerd packages which would conflict Docker CE installation. Before proceeding with Installation we must remove these conflicts.
 
Packages to be removed : runc, container-selinux

#yum remove runc
#yum remove container-selinux

Now we can install Docker CE successfully using Docker installation script

curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sh get-docker.sh
